# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2026-01-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project so that future
team members (and our future selves) can understand the reasoning behind our choices.

Without documented decisions, teams often revisit the same discussions, forget why
certain approaches were chosen, or make changes that conflict with earlier decisions.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard
in his article [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

See [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/) for more information on ADRs.

## Consequences

- All significant architecture decisions will be documented in this directory
- ADRs are numbered sequentially and never deleted (superseded instead)
- Each ADR describes the context, decision, and consequences
- Team members should review existing ADRs before proposing conflicting changes

*This project uses [stamp](https://github.com/stef16robbe/stamp) for managing ADRs.*
